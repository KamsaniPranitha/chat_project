# chat_project
A chat application is being developed using Express and WebSockets. Instead of plain WebSockets, Socket.io, a library wrapping WebSockets, is being utilized. Socket.io offers a fallback to xhr requests until the WebSocket connection is established, ensuring compatibility across browsers and simplifying development.WebSockets are an alternative to HTTP communication in Web Application, they offer full-duplex communication, that is, it is, bi-directional and that means the data can flow in both ways, so it can flow from client to the server and also from server to the client.
The frontend UI is based on Flexbox, without any external UI libraries, allowing for easy modification and customization.
